    <h2 id="youtube-google-privacy-policy">YouTube/Google Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>A user may choose to grant DevTube access to their Google user data by authenticating via Google/Youtube via the
      standard OAuth Consent Screen. </p>
    <p>DevTube will then retrieve the username, email, avatar, OAuth Access Token, and OAuth Refresh Token and store
      them
      securely in the corresponding user browser's Cookies, encrypted with the AES-256 algorithm. The basic user data –
      username, email, and avatar – are used to identify the user. The sensitive data – OAuth token – is used to let the
      user comment on YouTube videos directly from the DevTube. Because OAuth tokens automatically expire in 7 days, we
      use
      OAuth Refresh Token to refresh the Access Token after its expiration. <b>DevTube never shares Google user data
        with
        a
        3rd party and the use of Google user data is strictly limited to what's
        described in this privacy policy.</b></p>
